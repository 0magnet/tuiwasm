// RegisterDemoApplets turns every demo into a shell command.
//
// They used to be desk apps, each opening its own window with its own
// terminal. That made them things you launch rather than things you run, and
// it meant Ctrl+C had nowhere to return to — there was no shell underneath,
// only a window with a close button.
//
// As commands they behave the way the programs they demonstrate behave: they
// are typed at a prompt, they take the terminal for as long as they run, and
// they give it back. `help` lists them and `ls /bin` finds them, which is more
// discoverable than a launcher menu for anyone who already knows a shell.
