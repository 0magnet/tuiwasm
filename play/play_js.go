//go:build js && wasm

// Package play runs a demo in an xterm-go terminal.
//
// A demo is one of two shapes — it either writes styled text to an io.Writer
// or paints cells into a tcell.Screen — and getting either onto a terminal in
// a page takes more than calling it. The screen shape needs a tcell screen
// bridged to the terminal, a size that is the terminal's rather than tcell's
// hardcoded 80x24, a click handler so the window can take the keyboard, and a
// goroutine because PollEvent blocks and the page has one thread. Closing it
// again means undoing those in the right order.
//
// That was written three times inside this repository before it was written
// here. Anything embedding these demos — a desk window, a page, a texture on a
// quad in a 3D scene — needs the same thing, so it lives in a package of its
// own and takes a terminal the caller may already own.
