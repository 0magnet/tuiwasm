// Package flow drifts thousands of particles through a noise field and lets
// their trails draw it.
//
// # WHY CURL AND NOT THE NOISE ITSELF
//
// The obvious way to make a flow field is to read a direction out of a noise
// function directly. It looks wrong within a few seconds: a field made that
// way has sources and sinks in it, so every particle eventually falls into a
// drain and the screen ends up as a handful of bright clots with nothing
// moving between them.
//
// A fluid does not do that because it cannot: what flows in must flow out. The
// cheap way to get that property exactly rather than approximately is to take
// a scalar noise field as a stream function and use its perpendicular
// gradient — velocity = (∂ψ/∂y, −∂ψ/∂x). The divergence of that is
// ∂²ψ/∂x∂y − ∂²ψ/∂y∂x, which is zero identically — and differenced on the same
// stencil it is built from, the cancellation is term by term, so the field is
// divergence free to the last bit rather than to a tolerance. Particles follow
// the contours of ψ forever, and because ψ itself drifts slowly in time they
// are carried across it instead of running the same loop.
//
// # WHAT THE EYE SEES
//
// One particle is a moving dot and says nothing. What makes the field visible
// is the fading trail each one leaves: where many particles have crossed
// recently the deposits pile up and the streamline stands out bright, and
// where none have been the trail decays back to the background. The picture is
// therefore a time exposure of the field rather than a snapshot of it, which
// is the only way a structure this smooth becomes legible at a terminal's
// resolution.
//
// The noise is a small value-noise function written here rather than pulled
// in: two octaves on an integer lattice with a quintic fade, seeded from an
// integer. Gradient noise would have fewer grid-aligned artifacts, but nothing
// on screen shows the lattice — what is drawn is where particles went, not the
// noise — and value noise is half the arithmetic.
//
// Written from the description of the technique. No code is taken from any
// existing implementation.
