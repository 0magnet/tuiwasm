// Package parrot is the party parrot: a bird's head that rolls in a circle
// while its color runs once around the hue wheel per roll.
//
// # WHERE THIS COMES FROM, AND WHY NONE OF IT IS COPIED
//
// The party parrot began as a Slack emoji made from footage of Sirocco, a
// kākāpō, and reached terminals through `curl parrot.live` and `ascii.live`.
// Neither of those can be used here. ascii-live is GPL-3.0 and this repository
// is MIT, so vendoring its frames would relicense the repository; parrot.live
// and the nyancat server declare no license at all, which reserves every right
// by default. So this is written from a description of the effect and nothing
// else — the same footing as metaballs, which describes an effect libcaca also
// has and takes no code from it.
//
// # WHY IT IS DRAWN RATHER THAN PLAYED
//
// The original is ten fixed frames of sprite art. Ten frames is a filmstrip:
// it has one size, one palette cycle, and one bird, and at a terminal's
// aspect ratio it is either tiny or blocky.
//
// Drawing the bird instead — an ellipse for the head, a wedge for the beak, a
// few strokes for the crest, all in a local space that is scaled and rotated
// per frame — costs about the same code and gives three things a filmstrip
// cannot. It fills whatever window it is given. The roll is continuous rather
// than ten-position, so it does not strobe on a fast terminal. And because
// position and phase are parameters, a whole wall of parrots offset in phase
// costs one more loop, which is the form people actually want: not a parrot,
// a colonnade of them doing the wave.
//
// # THE MOTION
//
// The bird does not spin. It roll-bobs: the head tilts one way, dips, tilts
// back, dips again — two dips per full hue cycle — which is what reads as
// dancing rather than as a rotating asset. Everything below is a function of
// one phase angle, so the whole animation is seekable and the tests can ask
// for a specific pose.
