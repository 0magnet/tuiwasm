// Package fonts carries the TOIlet font collection, so that toilet-go renders
// something without a font directory installed.
//
// These are the twenty-four fonts TOIlet itself installs, copied unmodified
// from its source tree. They are separate works from the program and are
// redistributed here under their own licence: each one is by Sam Hocevar and is
// covered by the WTFPL, which the hand-written fonts state in their own comment
// block and which the generated ones inherit from TOIlet's COPYING and from its
// version banner, "TOIlet, along with the various TOIlet fonts and
// documentation, may be freely copied and distributed". See LICENSE in this
// directory.
//
// Nothing else is bundled. Fonts from the figlet collection have their own
// licences, several of which are not redistribution-friendly, so they are left
// to be loaded from a font directory at run time with -d.
